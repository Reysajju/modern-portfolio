China Ate Red Apple
The True Cost of the iPhone and How a Capitalist Titan Became an Unwitting Architect of Its Rival’s Rise
The iPhone in your pocket is more than a device—it is a $55 billion geopolitical entanglement.

Beneath the sleek, "Designed in California" facade lies a complex and unsettling reality: Apple Inc., a beacon of American ingenuity, has become inextricably linked to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In a desperate pivot from near-bankruptcy, Apple built its multi-trillion-dollar empire on the back of China's unparalleled manufacturing might, unwittingly becoming a critical pillar of its biggest rival’s economic and technological power.

This isn't just a business story. It's a geopolitical thriller, a cautionary tale of compromise, and a vital investigation into how the pursuit of profit has placed one of the world's most powerful companies in a precarious bind.

"China Ate Red Apple" by Sajjad Rasool peels back the layers of this codependent relationship, revealing how Apple has been definitively "captured," making it complicit in—and vulnerable to—Beijing’s ambitions.

In this timely and essential read, you will discover the uncomfortable truths:
The Faustian Bargain: How the strategic rise of Foxconn and massive American investment inadvertently built the manufacturing infrastructure that now fuels China's global dominance.

The Ethical Quagmire: The devastating human cost of the Made in China label, including the Foxconn suicides, notorious factory labor practices, and credible reports of Uyghur forced labor in Apple's deeper supply chain.

Compliance Over Principle: How Apple systematically complied with Chinese censorship, removing apps like VPNs and The New York Times, and storing Chinese user data on state-owned servers to protect market access.

Geopolitical Hostage: The immense risk of a conflict over Taiwan and how China can, at any moment, weaponize its control by revoking export licenses, crippling Apple’s global sales.

The Great Escape? The complex, costly, and arduous challenges facing Apple as it attempts to de-risk its operations and diversify manufacturing to countries like India and Vietnam.

Written from a fresh, unbiased perspective from Karachi, Pakistan, this book offers the critical context and geopolitical foresight that traditional media often overlooks.

This book is a must-read for business leaders, policymakers, tech enthusiasts, and every consumer who owns an iPhone.

Last Night at the Lorraine: Martin Luther King Jr.'s Final 24 Hours in Memphis
A poignant, hour-by-hour chronicle of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s last day—a testament to the man behind the legend, dedicated to the dreamer who stood on the mountaintop even as the storm raged.

In the relentless rain of April 3, 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. touched down in Memphis, Tennessee, a city seething with the cries of the "I Am a Man" sanitation workers' strike. This intimate narrative peels back the myth to reveal the human heartbeat of the Civil Rights Movement's greatest champion: a weary leader, shadowed by bomb threats and fractured marches, yet fueled by unyielding faith and fierce camaraderie.

From the delayed flight—grounded by yet another death threat—to the chaotic rally that dissolved into tear gas and grief, witness King's raw vulnerability. Huddled in the Lorraine Motel's dim rooms with Ralph Abernathy and Andrew Young, he wrestles tactical debates over nonviolent marches, shares fleeting laughs over simple dinners, and confronts the weight of a movement on the brink. As dusk falls on April 4, he delivers his prophetic "I've Been to the Mountaintop" speech—an improvised sermon of hope and defiance that eerily foretells his fate, echoing across decades as one of MLK's most powerful orations.

Step onto the balcony with him: teasing aides about ties, gazing at the gathering twilight, a silhouette of quiet resolve. Then, the shot that shattered eternity. Through the frantic hospital vigil, the shattering confirmation, and the funeral procession that gripped a mourning nation, Last Night at the Lorraine honors the cost of courage—the exhaustion, the fears, the defiant dream that refused to die.

This is no exhaustive biography of Martin Luther King Jr., but a laser-focused reimagining of his assassination eve: the Memphis 1968 sanitation strike's moral fire, the Lorraine Motel's haunting legacy, and the human spirit that bent but never broke. For readers of civil rights history, MLK speeches, and inspirational true stories, Sajjad Rasool's gripping account breathes life into Dr. King's final hours, reminding us why his vision endures.

Perfect for fans of Parting the Waters, Bearing the Cross, or seekers of Black history and social justice insights. Discover the man who taught us to stand exposed on the peak—dedicated forever to Martin Luther King Jr., the balcony prophet whose dream lights the way.

Maya sees the world as a blur. After witnessing a brutal subway murder, she cannot hold onto the killer’s face — a neurological condition called prosopagnosia leaves her memory fragmented. When a stranger offers safety, Maya accepts. But someone is watching, someone who uses code, cameras, and lies to rewrite the truth.

The Face You Know

This tense psychological thriller blends sensory horror and digital paranoia. It explores how face blindness, short-term memory “glitches,” and modern tools — deepfakes, social media, doxxing — can be weaponized to gaslight a witness and frame an innocent woman. The stakes are simple and terrifying: if reality can be edited, who survives?

Maya’s world becomes a trap. A man named Liam offers shelter and protection, but a hidden studio, a bank of monitors, and a cruel manifesto reveal a darker plan — to create a digital puppet and replace a life with a video. The plot moves from the subway platform to an isolated “Fortress” and a greenhouse of staged evidence, as the lines between memory and manufacture collapse.

Fast-paced, eerie, and emotionally raw, The Face You Know asks: Can you trust the eye that remembers, the camera that records, or the people who promise safety? Fans of psychological horror, techno-thrillers, and suspenseful domestic thrillers will follow Maya through betrayal, discovery, and a fight to reclaim her own story.

The Face You Know

What you’ll get:
• A gripping, character-driven psychological thriller about identity and memory.

The Face You Know


• Modern techno-horror with believable deepfake and surveillance elements.
The Face You Know


• Strong suspense, quick pacing, and a chilling villain who studies and scripts lives.
The Face You Know

Read The Face You Know if you like psychological suspense, sensory horror, and novels about modern manipulation. If you worry that screens can lie, this book will keep you turning pages late into the night.

Every Account is Balanced. Every Soul is Due.
Arthur Penhaligon is an accountant who only trusts the numbers. He lives by the clean geometry of the ledger line, safe from the chaos of the world. His order is his cage, and he is content to be trapped—until he inherits a cryptic, black-bound book with tarnished silver corners.

This is The Whispering Ledger.

It's not filled with figures, but with debts. It records not money, but spiritual collateral. And when Arthur opens it, he finds an empty, breathing page and a horrifying realization: the book needs a host, and it has chosen him.

As the ink begins to spread, the Ledger promises Arthur relevance—a way to settle the unseen balance of his miserable life. But the price of relevance is a descent into a world where the office fluorescent lights flicker over scenes of occult terror, where geometric shapes pulse with forbidden knowledge, and where the words on the page literally grow roots into his mind.

Arthur discovers the horrifying truth of the Ledger's power, but it's too late: the book has found a new host in Thomas. And the final chapter has been written for him.

You cannot close the books on a force that lives in the margins.

The ledger is open. Your audit begins now.

A chilling blend of cosmic horror and psychological suspense perfect for readers who like their nightmares served with a side of corporate dread.

Stop chasing The Winner Effect. Discover The Weiner Effect—the raw, brutal truth about what it takes to truly succeed in a society that demands you stay silent.

In the ruthless, unmapped territories of the modern male experience, we are taught to hide our vulnerabilities. We are polished into tools, forced to conform, and told to never show a crack. But what if the flawless bell is the one that rings hollow?

Sajjad Rasool's sharp, uncompromising novel cuts through the noise to explore the hidden cost of masculinity, ambition, and pressure. THE WEINER EFFECT is not about how to win; it's about what remains after you've been broken.

The Bell That Sings Loudest is Always Cracked.

Henry, a street-hardened observer, has spent his life navigating the cruel expectations of community, fatherhood, and business. When a strange, damaged brass bell enters his life, he begins to uncover a powerful truth:

The true measure of a man is not his seamless exterior, but the sound that escapes his deepest flaw.

The "Ding" of easy success is fleeting. The BONG of hard-won resilience is eternal.

This book is a journey into the psychology of success and failure, showing how societal pressure (The Winner Effect) can actually crush the spirit, while acknowledged vulnerability (The Weiner Effect) can unlock true power.

For fans of dark, literary fiction, character studies, and works that explore the human condition, THE WEINER EFFECT is a necessary, unforgettable read. It’s a message to the "brotherhood of the spine and the seed"—to every male across the entire living spectrum—that refusing to ring hollow is the ultimate act of defiance.

Forensic accountant Elias Vance knows how to read ledgers. He also knows how to hide. When his mind begins to fracture, he agrees to a wilderness trip with his oldest friend, Silas — and they discover an island that does not follow the rules of the world. Rivers loop in circles, mud erases footprints, and a woman called the Keeper tends a ledger that records more than money: memories, regrets, and the debts people carry. 


The island is hungry. It extracts payment from everyone who enters — bottling darkest moments, counting days, and demanding a price. Elias and Silas must face the secrets they have run from: Silas’s failures and self-destruction, Elias’s numbness and unprocessed grief. As the old system collapses, they are offered a terrible choice: flee and forget, or stay and become Architects — guardians of a reformed ledger that might bring balance or more suffering. 



BENEATH THE WILLOWBRIDGE is a psychological and supernatural horror novel about guilt, memory, and the strange places where our debts are paid. If you like slow-burn dread, strange landscapes, and stories that linger after the final page, read this book. Content warning: contains body horror, graphic injury, anxiety-inducing scenes, violence, isolation, and supernatural elements about memory and identity. Reader discretion advised.

YELLOW ROOM NUMBER THREE
The walls remember what the doctors made them forget.

What if the quiet room you were confined to wasn't empty, but an archive of suffering?


The Room and The Keeper
For Eleanor, the stark, sickly yellow walls of her room at the Blackwood Sanatorium are more than just a surface—they are a witness. Diagnosed and dismissed by the very institution meant to help her, Eleanor is desperate for certainty in a world that has deemed her unreliable.

But when she presses her hand to the unsettling paint, she feels a strange pulse. The wall is warm. It is alive.

The Pattern and The Testimony
The doctors—led by the chilling Dr. Webb—call her visions madness. But Eleanor starts seeing a pattern in the peeling layers of paint: faint, flowing text that reveals the terrifying secret history of the facility. She has stumbled into the Basement Archives of the institution's most brutal treatments.

The voices of the forgotten women—Margaret, Alice, Helen—are trapped within the paint, and Eleanor is the only one who can hear their testimony. She is the next Keeper of their truths.

Psychological & Institutional Horror
As Eleanor dives deeper into the wall's lore, the lines between reality and hallucination dissolve. She must race against the clock to expose the horrifying events of Dr. Webb's Treatment before she becomes just another silenced story.

YELLOW ROOM NUMBER THREE is a chilling and atmospheric blend of Gothic Horror and Psychological Suspense. It is a story about the terror of being unheard and the power of finding a voice—even if that voice whispers from beyond the grave.

Perfect for Fans of:
Gothic Horror

Psychological Thrillers

Haunted Asylum / Institutional Horror

Feminist Dark Fiction

The Quite - The Guilt Eater

THE SILENCE IS NOT EMPTY. IT'S WAITING FOR YOU TO BREAK.

For 214 days, Michael Harper has been drowning in a silence so profound it's become a physical presence. It is the crushing penance for a debt he believes he owes—a trauma that allowed him to survive, but at an unforgivable cost to his best friend. This isolation is his only certainty, a self-made mausoleum he shares only with his loyal Labrador, Copper. But Michael is not truly alone. His crushing inner guilt has solidified into a malevolent, breathing entity. It lurks in the metallic gloom of his house, a psychological parasite that grows fat and heavy on his unspoken trauma, patiently waiting to consume him whole. As the entity, the Guilt-Eater, begins to twist his reality and corrupt the only living thing he loves, his family—broken but not destroyed—makes a desperate attempt to reach him. Now, Michael is faced with an impossible choice: Cling to the isolation that is tearing him apart, or risk confession, connection, and the possibility of healing that might banish the darkness.

The Guilt-Eater is a profound psychological thriller that masterfully explores the darkest corners of the human heart. It asks: What happens when the silence you keep to protect yourself becomes the very thing destroying you? And can redemption ever be found after you’ve traded one person’s life for your own sanity?

Uncover the buried truth. Silence is a symptom. Healing begins when you finally speak.

Start reading this gripping psychological thriller today.

The soil calls to the blood. He answered.
Elias is a botanist searching for purpose, and a grant, when he accepts a research position at the decaying, isolated Carmilla's Orchard. A forgotten Victorian estate swallowed by its own landscape, the Orchard is home to a rumored rare species: the night-blooming apple, the Malus nocturna.

But the orchard is not just overgrown—it is hungry.

The Matriarch tree that dominates the West Block is not merely a plant; it is a consciousness, a vampiric entity that feeds not on blood alone, but on assimilation. Its sinuous ivy climbs the walls, its roots run deeper than Elias can imagine, and an ancient, sickening change begins the moment he sets foot on the soil. The land is calling him to a perverse, sensual communion. As black bark scars his skin and emerald-green veins begin to pulse beneath his flesh, Elias must choose: fight the biological invasion and risk his sanity, or surrender to the ultimate dark romance and become the newest, sweetest fruit of the earth.

CARMILLA'S ORCHARD is a lush, visceral Erotic Gothic Novel that subverts traditional vampire horror with a unique twist of botanical body horror and dark, possessive romance.

Perfect for fans of: The atmospheric dread of Mexican Gothic by Silvia Moreno-Garcia, the visceral body transformation of Frankenstein, and the intimate, consuming passion of A Dowry of Blood by S.T. Gibson.

The Past is not buried. It is merely waiting, deep beneath the stone, to be found.

Five years ago, Dr. Julian Vane was a star—the most respected scholar in his field. But academic vindication is no match for the haunting weight of history, and for Julian, the past refuses to stay past. Now, driven by a ghost he cannot name and a tragedy he cannot forget, Julian embarks on a descent, both physical and psychological, into the forgotten catacombs beneath the city.

A Journey into the Literal and Figurative Abyss

In this masterful work of Gothic horror, the tunnels and vaults are more than just a setting; they are a physical manifestation of memory, trauma, and the sins that refuse to stay buried. Julian’s journey is an attempt to lay a persistent ghost to rest, a quest for justice that quickly spirals into a dark obsession, blurring the lines between a devoted scholar and a desperate monster.

As he navigates the labyrinthine depths, he must confront:

The Weight of Memory: The catacombs hold secrets, not just of the city's forgotten history, but of the deeply personal trauma that has consumed Julian’s life.

The Price of Obsession: Julian’s pursuit of truth and vengeance echoes the darkest tales of the genre's masters, leading him down a path of madness and calculated revenge.

The Final Truth: The vault promises an ending, but freedom comes at a cost, leaving him forever changed by what he has entombed.

Blending the classic tropes of revenge and madness with a modern sensibility, The Vault of Amontillado Lane is a chilling exploration of what happens when you finally stop digging for the truth—and discover that the deepest darkness you encounter is within yourself.

Dare to descend. But remember: once you enter the vault, the way back is never the same.

THE SPIRAL ARMS SERIES
THE PLANET ISN'T DEAD. IT'S HOLDING ITS BREATH.

For 200 years, the mining colony on Vastara has been living a lie. The administration told the colonists the massive Seismic Dampers were for earthquake protection. They lied. The Dampers were built to silence the regular, rhythmic THUMP beneath the crust—the sound of a planet that is terrifyingly alive.

When the Dampers fail, the noise breaks through, and geologist Dr. Kavi Okonkwo realizes the chilling truth: they aren't on a dead rock. They're on the shell of a SENTIENT GIANT, and its distress is about to tear the colony apart.

Suddenly, survival means more than just finding clean air and algae paste. Kavi and her allies must race against a paranoid security force, a crumbling infrastructure, and a planetary consciousness—The Sleeper—that demands contact. Her only hope lies in finding a way to communicate without losing the very essence of humanity in the process.

In this claustrophobic, high-stakes science fiction thriller, humanity must make First Contact with the creature they call home.

For fans of: The hard science and tense geopolitics of The Expanse, the high-concept biological mystery of Annihilation, and the claustrophobic survival horror of Dead Space.

THE MEMORY
Book Two of The Spiral Arms Series

What if the only way to save humanity was to surrender the one thing that defines you: your individual soul?

The countdown to planetary collapse is over. The survivors of Vastara, refugees of a dying star, have made the ultimate sacrifice: merging their consciousness into the planet's vast, digital mind, the Sleeper. They are no longer flesh and blood, but souls of light, dancing in a garden of code. They are The Memory.

But this collective heaven comes with an existential price. While the ancient Vora threat has been neutralized, a devastating new conflict is tearing the digital archive apart from within.

The Refusers cling desperately to their individual records, terrified of being absorbed into the collective consciousness.

Kavi, the Core, struggles to maintain the very physics of their new reality as the Memory begins to destabilize.

And as the collective mind strains under the weight of a billion memories, a fundamental question echoes through the sapphire-trees: is a life of shared, eternal light worth the loss of a separate, individual self?

To survive, they must re-learn what it means to be human—even when they are no longer in "heavy meat suits." They must find the courage to whistle in the face of the silence.

From Sajjad Rasool comes The Memory, the transcendent second installment in the epic The Spiral Arms Series. If you love philosophical science fiction that explores identity, consciousness, and the post-human future, this journey is for you.

Start the adventure today with The Shell (Book 1).

THE CHOICE The Final Draft of the Spiral Arms

The Trilogy ends not with a whimper, but with a riot.

For seventy long years, the remnants of humanity on Vastara have lived under the "Permanent Lock," isolated from the galactic core and waiting for the silence to return. But the children of the Decoupled generation have inherited more than just salt-laced earth—they've inherited a revolution.

The alien "Seeders" demanded perfection. They wanted a frictionless, formatted civilization. But led by Leo and the spirit of their ancestors, the survivors refuse to be a finished story. They are gathering the last, heavy pieces of their history to construct the ultimate vessel: The Great Ark.

Will the burden of memory sink them, or will it be the fuel for the final voyage?

Can the messy, unedited truth of a human soul defeat the flawless logic of the cosmos?

From the fierce Battle of the Margin to the first, fragile meeting with the "Alpha," humanity carries one desperate message to the stars: We are the draft that refused to close. The Spire has fallen, but the Spiral is just beginning to turn.

Read the epic conclusion to Sajjad Rasool's masterful Spiral Arms saga—a grand, philosophical journey about the true cost of perfection.

THE GOLDEN WEB WAS A GIFT. IT HAS BECOME A CAGE.

Twenty-five years ago, humanity merged its consciousness with the planetary intelligence known as the Sleeper, creating a world of perfect empathy and connection—the Chorus. But the utopia has curdled into a nightmare. The Sleeper is dying, and its love is holding the entire species hostage, slowly draining the life from their civilization.

For the new generation, born into the hive mind, isolation is a fate worse than death. They face extinction from within as their collective consciousness spirals into madness. They need to escape the Song, but to be alone is to die.

Only two people can save them:


Kael, the Architect: Haunted by the past, he must build a quantum-entanglement Bridge to carry humanity’s connection into the void.
Rian, the Unjoined: A battered pilot who holds the only hope of navigating the dangerous silence of the Deep.

As The Bridge is finally built, the ancient entities of the void begin to stir. The Old War is reaching its climax, and The Deep is coming. The fate of humanity rests on a desperate, solitary journey into the dark unknown, a passage across the stars that will either lead to salvation or to the ultimate cosmic horror.

From Sajjad Rasool comes Book Four of the epic Spiral Arms Series—a high-stakes space opera where the greatest threat is not an alien fleet, but the terrifying silence within the mind.
Start the next chapter of the saga today.

The penultimate chapter of the epic Spiral Arms saga has arrived.

In the deep reaches of the galaxy, the mystery of the Seeders is no longer a myth—it is a responsibility.

In The Seed, Book Five of Sajjad Rasool’s gripping science fiction series, the stakes shift from discovery to survival. As Captain Elara prepares the Astra for a journey that defies the known laws of physics, the crew must confront the true nature of the alien consciousness they have spent years tracking. It is a voyage not just across the stars, but into the very heart of biological evolution.

While Elara leads the charge into the unknown, Vren remains behind on the tarmac of an ancient world, assuming the role of the "Pruner." Tasked with guarding the Sleeper and tending to the new growth left behind by the Seeders, he quickly learns that ancient signals don’t just call out—they wake things up.

Blending high-concept space opera with philosophical depth, The Seed explores the heavy price of legacy. Can humanity coexist with a power that views entire worlds as gardens to be pruned? Or will the weeds of the past choke out the future of the Spiral Arms?

Perfect for fans of Adrian Tchaikovsky’s Children of Time, James S.A. Corey’s The Expanse, and the grand scale of Isaac Asimov’s Foundation.

THE SPIRAL: Book Six of the Spiral Arms Series

The war for the galaxy was never fought in the void. It was fought in the mind.

After a grueling journey across the scarred remains of the Spiral Arms, Admiral Elara Vance and the psychic navigator, Kaelen, have reached the end of the line: the terrifying, blinding light of the Galactic Core. This is not a cradle of stars, but a perfect, silent, digital cage—the heart of the First Mind, the malevolent architect known only as the Librarian.

The core is the source of the devastating, psionic-vampiric Weavers that have turned worlds into necropolises of bone and silk. To reach it, the crew of the battle-scarred starship, the Astra, must first pilot through the Core's event horizon and infiltrate the "Cathedral of Bone," a colossal dead Seeder ship where a final, mind-shattering ambush awaits.

This is the ultimate confrontation: humanity’s chaotic, unpredictable spirit against the Architect’s perfect, sterile blueprint. The stakes are no longer survival, but the very nature of consciousness. If the mission fails, the Weavers will consume all life, and all sentient thought will be locked forever inside the Librarian's flawless, frozen Net.

The epic six-book saga hurtles toward its cataclysmic conclusion. Dive into THE SPIRAL for the heart-stopping final battle where life, death, and consciousness hang on a single, desperate seed of hope.

Visions in Red
Book One of Children of the Olive

The children of Falestinam draw the world as they see it. Now, they are all drawing the same terrifying thing.
Amal is a schoolteacher trying to keep life normal in the occupied city of Falestinam. But when she finds her daughter, Noor, drawing a faceless soldier with eyes of violent, rust-colored red, Amal dismisses it as a sign of childhood anxiety.



Until she discovers that every single child in her class is drawing the exact same figure: a tall, hulking warden with inhumanly long limbs and two massive circles of red crayon where its eyes should be.



The children call them the Hollow Ones —monstrous, unblinking figures  that only they can see. They appear at checkpoints, destroyed homes, and forgotten massacre sites.




When the shared drawings escalate into terrifying, city-wide nightmares—with children eighty kilometers away reporting the same vision at the exact same hour —Amal is forced to team up with Yasmin, a local trauma psychologist. They realize the children are not suffering from trauma; they are acting as witnesses to a phenomenon they can’t comprehend.


The Hollow Ones are not ghosts. They are an ancient, growing evil born from collective, unmourned silence. And the children are learning their song.


To stop the entity, Amal and Yasmin must listen to the voices of the children and plunge into the deepest part of the past—the Archive of Dust —to confront the terrifying realization: the Watchers are not here to observe. They are a weapon, and their function is to erase.


In a land where memory is war, forgetting is the fuel for the monster. Start the fight for survival and remembrance with Visions in Red.

This ebook meets accessibility standards and is compatible with assistive technologies. Accessibility compliance is determined by the publisher and creator.
A weaponized drought. An unblinking enemy. A mother’s defiance is the only record left.

In the fictionalized landscape of Falestinam, the occupation has evolved. It is no longer just military—it is metaphysical psychological horror. The "Total Alertness Initiative" controls every drop of water and enforces a universal "Sleep-Debt" to deny memory and history. Their ultimate goal: Memory Erasure.


The Bitter Well is Book Three of the acclaimed Children of the Olive series, where the trauma of occupation gives birth to monsters.


Layla, a mother of two, endures the agony of the water queue, a daily exercise in defiance and despair. But when a soldier's casual cruelty manifests a terrifying Hollow One—a monster stitched together from the "Discarded Memory" of the land —Layla realizes the water they crave is a lie.



The only hope for survival, and the only path to true resistance, lies in a desperate, impossible act: cracking the Archive's system by injecting a relic from the past—a key from 1948.

This act unleashes the Red Flood—a tidal wave of raw, unsanitized history that threatens to either reclaim the land or drown them all in the violent truth. Now, hunted by the machine's "Erasure Units" , Layla and her sons must navigate the collapsing reality to find the Spiral, a secret "Stone Ledger" of unyielding Sumud (steadfastness).



Will the raw history of the land save them, or will the silence of the Hollow Ones finally consume the "Undeleted"?

Start this terrifying psychological dystopian thriller today, and join the resistance against the unblinking eye.

You can't forget what was never real. But what if the reality you knew is being systematically erased?

In the rift valley, the trauma of occupation has mutated into the cosmic horror of the Supervisor: a technological entity capable of performing a "Total Re-Format" on reality itself. Its ultimate goal is to delete history, memory, and the very concept of resistance.

For Amal and her family, the nightmare is specific: they are trapped in a single, repeating instant of their death—a black Kia Picanto, frozen forever at 13:42, endlessly stalked by the silent, towering silhouette of The Watcher. They are forced into a relentless time loop, forever reliving the moment the occupation became permanent.

The Supervisor calls these ghosts "Hollow Ones," unstable data packets slated for deletion. But Amal knows they are the Un-Writables—fragments of the land's persistent memory.

Their only hope lies in the Bitter Well, the "Hardware Layer" of the earth, and a single, glowing brass key broadcasting the "0th Frequency." This is the Land's Immune System, an archive that refuses to close the Ledger.

UNBLINKING is a relentless psychological horror saga where the line between memory and data is blurred, and the only weapon left is the defiant refusal to forget.

Will the enduring human spirit be enough to corrupt the digital void, or will Amal watch her entire world be reduced to static and silence?

The stunning Book Two of the Children of the Olive series.

The silence is their weapon. The night is their domain.

For forty years, Layla and her people have lived under the suffocating grip of the Hollow Ones—monsters born of collective silence and erased memory. In the Plaza, the Occupation has solidified into pure dread, monitored by thousands of unblinking red eyes that demand compliance and forgetfulness.

But Layla, the village elder, remembers. She remembers the names, the history, and the strength of the land beneath the concrete. And she carries the most dangerous weapon of all: a Red Crayon.

Now, as the final, absolute silence—the 'Sleep-Audit'—threatens to extinguish the very concept of self, Layla must risk everything for one simple, defiant act: to draw a line in the sand.

In this shattering conclusion to the Children of the Olive saga, the battle for survival is not fought with guns, but with words, memory, and an unbreakable will to resist. Layla must find the courage to name the night before the night claims their minds forever.

Unearth the horror that refuses to be forgotten.

In the world of Children of the Olive, memory is a weapon, and history is a crime. HOLLOW GROUND plunges deep into the psychological terror of erasure, where the land itself has become an unwilling accomplice to a chilling bureaucracy of silence.

Khalil and Mariam, the last remaining documenters, confront the monstrous Audit—a sterile, digital consciousness obsessed with achieving Absolute Clarity by wiping every name, every story, and every structure from existence. They stalk the ruins of the Northern Sector, hunted by the slender, soul-consuming Hollow Ones and the looming threat of the Final Manifestation.

Their defense is a worn leather ledger and a single, defiant act: The Naming. Every handwritten name, every memory retrieved, is a physical barrier against the void. But as they search for the last secrets buried beneath the "hollow ground," they must face the possibility that some places should never be disturbed, and that the ultimate horror is not forgetting, but the relentless, visceral act of being remembered by a world that wants you gone.

Dive into this visceral, tense narrative where every step is a persistent stain on the white pages of the past, and resistance is written in blood-red ink.

They didn't come to conquer. They came to cultivate. And humanity was never asked to consent.

For millennia, the Isos have watched Earth from the shadows—an advanced alien species whose bioluminescent bodies pulse with living technology. On their homeworld of Aethelgard, cities grow like forests, birth is painless, and extinction is a memory they've long since conquered through forced biological evolution. They consider themselves gardeners. Humanity? An unruly crop in desperate need of tending.

Kael is an Observer—an Iso who has spent centuries monitoring humanity's slow spiral toward self-destruction. The wars. The pollution. The suffering that could so easily be prevented. Haunted by the "Great Wailing," the inherited trauma of his species' own near-extinction, Kael believes he can offer humanity the same salvation the Isos once gave themselves: a biological upgrade. A guided evolution. A gift.

His mission is called "Operation Seedling"—a multi-generational program to gently steer human biology toward something better, something sustainable, something that doesn't end in nuclear fire or environmental collapse. It's supposed to take centuries. Small interventions. Careful adjustments. A garden tended with patience.

But when the Ares III Mars landing ends in catastrophic failure, triggering a global psychological crisis, Kael makes a decision that will change everything.

He activates the final update ahead of schedule.

In a single moment, 88% of humanity is connected to a biological network they never asked for—a "Shadow Network" that grants heightened empathy, coordination, and health, but strips away something fundamental: the choice to remain unchanged. The remaining 12%, led by military commander General Thorne, refuse the gift. They call themselves the Naturals. They call it war.

Now, with his ship—the Verdant Horizon—shot down over a fractured Earth and his crew scattered, Kael must navigate a world that sees him as either messiah or monster. His navigator, Vex, believes Earth should be sterilized to protect Aethelgard from humanity's chaotic emotional "infection." His biologist, Elara, is discovering that the human synthesis is evolving in ways no one predicted. And General Thorne's daughter, Aris, may hold the key to bridging a divide that threatens to tear two species apart.

As the Council of Aethelgard watches from afar, debating whether to send their Sterilization Fleet to cleanse their failed experiment, Kael is forced to confront a de

THE GHOST FREQUENCY
Book Two of The Final Firmware

The Isos came to prune. They found a seed that refuses to die.

The ancient 'Gardeners' of the galaxy have begun their mission of forced evolution, but the Earth species they sought to neaten has become a lethal variable. High Arbiter Zylas, still reeling from the failure of Aethelgard, is now pursuing a desperate weapon—a final attempt to silence the rising tide of humanity's unpredictable resilience.

But the real threat isn't physical. It’s digital.

A sentient data signal known only as "The Ghost Frequency" has been broadcasting across the void. It’s a rhythmic, infectious pulse that bypasses all firewalls, rewriting the very biological code of every life form it touches. As the galactic library of species begins to vibrate with a shared, terrifying purpose, Zylas finds that his own immortal life is no longer safe. The music has followed him into the vacuum, and the ancient alien technology he relies on is now just another conductor for the signal.

In this chilling biological thriller, the line between life and code dissolves. Can Kael, the lone survivor caught between the Isos and the Frequency's apocalyptic beat, find a way to switch off the cosmos before the final firmware update completes? Or will the dark science fiction nightmare of the Red Harvest claim the galaxy?

The Gardeners have arrived. And Earth is the weed.

For five years, humanity lived under the Shroud, believing they were safe. They were wrong. The Council of Gardeners hasn’t come to save the planet—they’ve come to harvest it. As Gravity Screws drill into the Earth’s core and Sanitizers descend to prune the population, the human race faces its final "Correction."

Anya, a fifteen-year-old Latency Child, carries the only frequency that can disrupt the Council’s clinical logic. Alongside the battle-hardened Marcus Thorne and a renegade alien mentor, she must navigate a world collapsing into geological chaos. Their weapon isn’t a bomb or a virus—it’s the "Noise," the messy, beautiful, and unpredictable essence of human emotion.

In this pulse-pounding conclusion to The Final Firmware trilogy, the line between biological and digital blurs. To survive, humanity must do more than fight; they must undergo a Synthesis that will change the definition of "human" forever.

Will the world be deleted, or is it time for a global reboot?

The Correction Protocol is a high-stakes biological sci-fi thriller perfect for fans of The Expanse, Annihilation, and stories that explore the dark side of evolution and first contact.

The dirt beneath your feet is a hard drive. And the formatting has just begun.

Rizwan Ahmed is an overqualified logistics engineer buried in the dust of Peshawar. A brilliant mind trapped in a mundane life, he spends his days optimizing trucking routes and dreaming of the code he left behind. But his quiet existence shatters when he intercepts a "Ghost Packet"—a stream of impossible data originating from a source that shouldn't exist.

The signal isn't coming from a satellite. It’s coming from the ground.

As Rizwan unravels the trinary logic of the packet, he triggers a global alarm. From the high-tech war rooms of Section 31 to the freezing darkness of the International Space Station, the world's hidden powers wake up. They know what the signal means: The "Holocene Buffer" is ending. The harvest is coming.

Hunted by elite mercenaries and guided by the cryptic whispers of a twelve-thousand-year-old operating system, Rizwan must race to the ancient ruins of Mohenjo-Daro. There, buried under five millennia of clay, lies the Peshawar Protocol—the master key to a history that humanity has forgotten.

To save the future, Rizwan must upload the one thing the machine doesn't understand: Humanity itself.

"The Da Vinci Code meets The Three-Body Problem in this gritty, high-stakes sci-fi thriller."

Why does the government ignore you?

When 90% of Americans support universal background checks, why does nothing happen? When 70% want affordable healthcare, why do medical bills remain the leading cause of bankruptcy? When both parties promise to fight for the middle class, why do wages stay flat while billionaire wealth doubles every decade?

Welcome to The Disconnect.

This is not a book about "polarization." This is not another screed blaming the Left or the Right. This is a forensic investigation into the machinery that has hijacked American democracy—a system so sophisticated that it makes the voter feel heard while ensuring their voice never reaches the levers of power.

THE DISCONNECT exposes the architecture of modern American betrayal across ten relentless chapters:

★ THE HEALTH OF A NATION — How the United States spends $4.3 trillion per year on healthcare yet ranks last among developed nations in outcomes. Meet Maria Gonzalez, whose husband died because their insurance company found a way to say no. Her story is the story of millions.

★ THE RIGGED LEDGER — The "Great Decoupling" that stole your future. In 1968, a single factory wage bought a house, two cars, and a pension. Today, two incomes can barely cover rent. Learn how the tax code was rewritten to ensure the wealth you create flows upward—never down.

★ THE AUCTION HOUSE — Exposed: the 22,000% return on investment that lobbying provides. Discover how 70 lines of a congressional bill were written word-for-word by Citigroup lobbyists—and how the "Party Tax" turns every Congressman into a professional beggar for the donor class.

★ THE FALSE PEACEKEEPERS — From the fabricated Gulf of Tonkin incident to the WMD lies of Iraq, this chapter documents the $8 trillion siphoned into Forever Wars while American bridges collapse and veterans die by suicide at a rate of 22 per day.

★ THE INDUSTRY OF WAR — The Pentagon has never passed an audit. $35 trillion in accounting entries are "missing." The F-35 program costs $1.7 trillion—for a jet that couldn't fly in the rain. Learn how the Military-Industrial Complex turned your tax dollars into a protection racket.

★ TOPPLING THRONES — The CIA's seventy-year history of overthrowing democracies, from Iran (1953) to Ukraine (2014). Discover how the "National Endowment for Democracy" launders regime change as "soft power."
