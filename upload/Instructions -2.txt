Take your time to enhance this plan. 
This is how we transform your background—from Chemistry and Quality Assurance to a stealth startup board member—into a high-end, "Old Money Modernist" digital ecosystem.
🏗️ The Tech Stack & Global Styles
We will use React with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion for that "Super Human Friendly" fluid motion.
The Global CSS (Evergreen Palette)
/* index.css */
:root {
  --forest: #1B3022; /* Deep Evergreen */
  --paper: #F5F2ED;  /* Rich Cream */
  --gold: #C5A059;   /* Burnished Gold */
}

body {
  background-color: var(--paper);
  color: var(--forest);
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif; /* Human Friendly UI */
}

h1, h2, .serif {
  font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; /* Old Money Aesthetics */
}

// DockNav.jsx
const Dock = () => (
  <nav className="fixed bottom-6 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 bg-forest/90 backdrop-blur-md px-6 py-3 rounded-full border border-gold/30 flex gap-8">
    {['Home', 'Archive', 'Library', 'Arsenal', 'Engine', 'Contact'].map((item) => (
      <button key={item} className="text-paper hover:text-gold transition-colors text-sm font-medium uppercase tracking-widest">
        {item}
      </button>
    ))}
  </nav>
);

To ensure we haven't missed a single detail for your high-end digital portal, here is the comprehensive breakdown of our collaboration, your specific needs, and the "gaps" filled with a narrative that connects your background in Chemistry and Quality Assurance to your current role as a stealth founder.
🏛️ The Project Summary
What We Established

💻 The React Implementation Snippet
To get you started with a "Super Human Friendly" and "Super Adaptable" structure, use this layout component:
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

const MainLayout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div className="bg-paper min-h-screen font-sans text-forest selection:bg-gold selection:text-paper">
      {/* 1. Manual Ad Space */}
      <div className="h-10 bg-forest flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden border-b border-gold/20">
        <p className="text-[10px] uppercase tracking-[0.4em] text-gold animate-pulse">
          Presented by [Sponsor Name] — Archive Edition 2026
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* 2. Main Content */}
      <main className="pt-20 pb-32 px-6 md:px-12 max-w-7xl mx-auto">
        {children}
      </main>

      {/* 3. The Command Center (Floating Dock) */}
      <nav className="fixed bottom-8 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 z-50">
        <div className="bg-forest/80 backdrop-blur-xl border border-gold/30 rounded-full px-8 py-4 flex gap-8 items-center shadow-2xl">
          {['Home', 'Archive', 'Library', 'Blog', 'Contact'].map((link) => (
            <motion.a
              key={link}
              whileHover={{ y: -4, color: '#C5A059' }}
              href={`#${link.toLowerCase()}`}
              className="text-paper text-xs uppercase tracking-widest font-bold"
            >
              {link}
            </motion.a>
          ))}
        </div>
      </nav>
    </div>
  );
};

🛠️ Filling the Gaps: The "Stealth Founder" Narrative
Since your resume shows a shift from Chemistry and QA to a Board Member role, your website needs to explain why this makes sense.
The Story: > "I don't just build products; I audit systems. My background in Chemical Sciences taught me how variables interact at the most granular level. My time in Quality Assurance taught me how to scale those variables without breaking the system. Today, I apply that same 'Molecular Precision' to the boards of high-growth startups."
